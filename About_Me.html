		<em>It's nice to make your cyber acquaintance...</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		Obviously you have questions, or else you wouldn't have clicked on the 'About' tab.  I will see if i can muster up some answers for you...
		<br>
		<br>
		Born and raised at the base of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, United States, North America, Earth, etc. For the past 34 years I've spent most of my time exploring this vast existence we somehow find ourselves tangled within. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I consider myself a jack of all trades and master of none. Although I believe high levels of excellence are possible, mastery is never quite possible...this seems to be the carrot on the sting compelling us to improve ourselves.  As such, I strive for high levels of understanding and accomplishment; while at the same time reminding myself that using the finite (our experience) to define the infinite (the universe) is a hopeless pursuit. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Currently I find myself at a major turning point, in which I am learning a completely new skill (web design) with the goal of turning it a viable carrer for the benefit of my family.  In the past I have worked a few dead enders and filled plenty of painful positions; only to be left with the feeling of seperation from myself and the world around me.  <strong>I say no more!</strong> 
		<br>
		<br>
		As you may have guessed this website is just a place for me to practice and develop my skills. Have fun exploring this website as I explore the new world of coding. Bookmark and check back periodically as I plan to update as much as possible!
		<br>
		<br>
		Well then, I think thats enough about me.  Tell me about yourself... Head on over to <a href="http://HeavyMeta.ununique3.com" target="_blank">HeavyMeta.ununique3.com</a> if you feel compelled to comment or share.
